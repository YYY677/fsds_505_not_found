## 2. Why did they collect the InsideAirbnb data?

::: {.duedate}

( 4 points; Answer due Week 7 )

Inside Airbnb is a mission driven project that provides data and advocacy about Airbnb's impact on residential communities.

"We work towards a vision where communities are empowered with data and information to understand, decide and control the role of renting residential homes to tourists."




:::

```{python}
#| output: asis
print(
    f"One of way to embed output in the text looks like this: after cleaning, we were left with {df.shape[0]:,} rows of data."
)
```

This way is also supposed to work (`{python} f"{df.shape[0]:,}" `) but I've found it less reliable.

```{python}
ax = df.host_listings_count.plot.hist(bins=50)
ax.set_xlim([0, 500]);

## 6. With reference to the InsideAirbnb data (*i.e.* using numbers, figures, maps, and descriptive statistics), what does an analysis of Hosts and the types of properties that they list suggest about the nature of Airbnb lettings in London? 

`Data: the latest airbnb dataset for london published on 06 September 2024.`

### 6.1 Analysis of Hosts

```{python}
# read the latest airbnb listings dataset
df22 = pd.read_csv('data/listings.csv.gz', compression='gzip', low_memory=False)
```

```{python}
#| output: false

#expand count limitation of column display
pd.options.display.max_columns = 75 

# df22.info()
```

```{python}
# convert df(pandas) file to gdf(geopandas, which contains spatial column)
gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(df22, crs='EPSG:4326', geometry=gpd.points_from_xy(df22.longitude, df22.latitude)).to_crs(27700)

gdf = gdf[['host_since', 'host_id', 'host_listings_count', 'property_type', 'room_type', 'price', 'minimum_nights']]
# gdf.info()
```

```{python}
#| output: false

# This code chunk is about Wrangling Data

# Ensure 'host_since' is in datetime format
gdf['host_since'] = pd.to_datetime(gdf['host_since'], errors='coerce')
# Drop rows with NaT in 'host_since'
gdf = gdf.dropna(subset=['host_since'])

# Extract the year from 'host_since'
gdf['year'] = gdf['host_since'].dt.year.fillna(-1).astype(int)

# Handle missing values in 'host_listings_count'
gdf['host_listings_count'] = gdf['host_listings_count'].fillna(-1).astype(int)

# Clean 'price' column and convert it to float
gdf['price'] = gdf['price'].astype(str)
gdf['price'] = gdf['price'].str.replace('$','', regex=False).str.replace(',','', regex=False).astype(float).fillna(-1)

# Convert 'property_type' and 'room_type' to categorical data types
gdf['property_type'] = gdf['property_type'].astype('category')
gdf['room_type'] = gdf['room_type'].astype('category')

# gdf.head()
```

```{python}
#| output: false

gdf.info()
gdf['year'].min()
```

#### 6.1.1 Distribution of the Number of Listings per Host

```{python}
#| output: false

# This code chunk is to look at 'Distribution of the Number of Listings per Host'.

# Group by 'host_id' to count the number of listings per host
host_counts = gdf.groupby('host_id').size()

# Define bins and labels for the grouping
bins = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, float('inf')]  # 分组区间
labels = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10+']  # 分组标签

# Group the host counts into bins
host_counts_bins = pd.cut(host_counts, bins=bins, labels=labels, right=True)

# Count total listings per group (number * number of listings per host)
listings_per_group = host_counts.groupby(host_counts_bins).apply(lambda x: (x * x.index.to_series().value_counts()).sum())

# Calculate total number of listings
total_listings = listings_per_group.sum()
percentages = (listings_per_group / total_listings) * 100

# Plotting the bar chart
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
bars = plt.bar(listings_per_group.index, listings_per_group.values, color='skyblue')

# Add labels with counts and percentages
for bar, count, pct in zip(bars, listings_per_group.values, percentages):
    plt.text(
        bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2,  # x 坐标
        bar.get_height() + 0.5,  # y 坐标
        f'{count:.0f}\n({pct:.1f}%)',  # 标签内容
        ha='center', va='bottom', fontsize=10
    )

# Set the title and axis labels
plt.title('Distribution of Listings by Listings per Host', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('Listings per Host (Grouped)', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Total Listings', fontsize=14)

# Rotate x-axis labels for better readability
plt.xticks(rotation=45)

# Display the plot
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

In London, only 47.8% (45,932 listings) are owned by single-listing hosts, while the remaining 52.2% are held by multi-listing hosts.  
Notably, hosts with 10 or more listings account for 20.8% (20,038 listings) of the total.

**conclusion:**

1. Prevalence of multi-listing hosts: more than half of all listings owned by multi-listing hosts, indicating that multi-listing is common in london.
2. Professional landlords: hosts who owned 10+ listings owned more than one fifth listings, suggesting a significant presence of professional landlords in the market.

#### 6.1.2 Changes in the number of landlords and renters over the years

```{python}
# --- Count the number of new host IDs added each year ---
new_hosts_per_year = gdf.drop_duplicates('host_id').groupby('year').size()

# --- Count the cumulative number of host IDs each year ---
year_range = range(int(gdf['year'].min()), int(gdf['year'].max()) + 1)
id_per_year = [gdf[gdf['year'] <= year].shape[0] for year in year_range]

# Create a DataFrame to display results
result_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Year': year_range,
    'New Hosts': new_hosts_per_year.reindex(year_range, fill_value=0),
    'Total Listings Count': id_per_year
})

# Plotting the data
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(20, 12))  # Greatly increased figure size

# --- Plot the number of new hosts added each year (bar chart) ---
bars = ax1.bar(result_df['Year'], result_df['New Hosts'], color='#6baed6', label='New Hosts per Year', alpha=0.8)
ax1.set_xlabel('Year', fontsize=24, fontweight='bold')  # Significantly larger font size
ax1.set_ylabel('New Hosts', color='#6baed6', fontsize=24, fontweight='bold')
ax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='#6baed6', labelsize=22)
ax1.tick_params(axis='x', labelsize=22)

# Annotate bar heights with values
for bar in bars:
    height = bar.get_height()
    ax1.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2, height, f'{int(height)}', 
             ha='center', va='bottom', fontsize=18, color='#6baed6')  # Slightly smaller font for annotations

# --- Add a second y-axis for cumulative listings (line chart) ---
ax2 = ax1.twinx()
lines = ax2.plot(result_df['Year'], result_df['Total Listings Count'], color='#fd8d3c', marker='o', markersize=10, label='Total Listings Count')
ax2.set_ylabel('Listings Count', color='#e6550d', fontsize=24, fontweight='bold')
ax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='#e6550d', labelsize=22)

# Annotate line chart points with values
for x, y in zip(result_df['Year'], result_df['Total Listings Count']):
    ax2.text(x, y + 500, f'{int(y)}', ha='center', va='bottom', fontsize=18, color='#e6550d')  # Slightly smaller font for annotations

# --- Set x-axis ticks to display years as integers ---
plt.xticks(ticks=result_df['Year'], labels=result_df['Year'], rotation=45, fontsize=22)

# --- Add a legend ---
fig.legend(loc='upper left', bbox_to_anchor=(0.1, 0.95), fontsize=20)

# --- Set the title of the plot ---
plt.title('Yearly New Hosts and Listings on Airbnb in London', fontsize=30, fontweight='bold')

# --- Display the plot ---
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

* Based on Airbnb's dataset for London, the whole story started in 2008 and the growth in hosts and listings was slow between 2008 and 2010, **accelerating sharply from 2011 to 2016**. The peak occurred in 2015, with 8,939 new hosts, while 2014 and 2016 saw increases of over 7,000 hosts each. By 2016, total listings neared 50,000. 

* However, **growth slowed in subsequent years**, with 2020 and 2021 adding only around 1,600 hosts and 3,000 listings annually—nearly half the growth seen in 2019—largely due to the pandemic’s impact on the rental market. From 2022 to 2024, post-pandemic recovery is evident, but growth remains far below peak levels.

### 6.2 Analysis of property
#### 6.2.1 Distribution of room types of property

```{python}
#| output: false

# Count the number of each property type
property_counts = gdf['property_type'].value_counts()

# Filter out the categories with frequency greater than 200
filtered_property_counts = property_counts[property_counts > 200]

# Calculate the percentage for each category
total_count = property_counts.sum()  # 总的数量
filtered_percentage = (filtered_property_counts / total_count) * 100

# Draw a bar chart
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
bars = filtered_property_counts.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')

# Add title and tag
plt.title('Distribution of Property Types (Count > 200)')
plt.xlabel('Property Type')
plt.ylabel('Count')

for bar, count, percentage in zip(bars.patches, filtered_property_counts, filtered_percentage):
    height = bar.get_height()
    # Show count at the top and percentage at the bottom
    plt.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2, height + 10, f'{count}', 
             ha='center', va='bottom', fontsize=9)
    plt.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2, height - 10, f'({percentage:.1f}%)', 
             ha='center', va='top', fontsize=9)

plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

```{python}
#| output: false

room_type_counts = gdf['room_type'].value_counts()
room_type_percentage = gdf['room_type'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100

room_type_stats = pd.DataFrame({
    'Count': room_type_counts,
    'Percentage': room_type_percentage
})

room_type_stats
```

***Room type of property*** is divided into four categories.

- Entire home/apt: 63.8%
- Private room: 35.6%
- Shared room: 0.45%
- Hotel room: 0.2%

1. Privacy and space are top priorities for most Airbnb hosts and guests. The high proportion of entire homes/apt indicates that many guests prefer independent accommodations for greater privacy and autonomy.  
    This aligns with a broader shift in tourism, where more visitors are opting for alternative lodging options instead of traditional hotels to enjoy a more spacious and private environment [@zervas2017rise].
2. The 35.6% share of private rooms suggests that some guests are still willing to choose more affordable accommodations, even if it means sharing common spaces. These listings cater to budget-conscious travelers.
3. The low percentages of shared rooms and hotel rooms indicate that Airbnb's core market in London, a well-established market, tends to favor more private lodging options.

#### 6.2.2 Distribution of Minimum Nights for Rental

```{python}
#| output: false

# Create a subplot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 4))  # Single subplot

# Set values greater than 35 to 35
gdf['minimum_nights_clipped'] = np.where(gdf['minimum_nights'] > 35, 35, gdf['minimum_nights'])
bins = list(range(1, 37))  # Bins from 1 to 35, with 35+ combined into one bin

# Plot the histogram for 'minimum_nights' column
ax.hist(gdf['minimum_nights_clipped'], bins=bins, color='lightblue', edgecolor='black')

# Add a vertical line for the threshold (at 30 days)
ax.axvline(x=30, color='black', linestyle='--', linewidth=1.5, label='STR Threshold (30 days)')

# Calculate the proportion below the 30-day threshold
threshold = 30
below_threshold = gdf[gdf['minimum_nights'] < threshold].shape[0]  # Count of listings below 30 days
total_entries = gdf.shape[0]  # Total count of listings
percentage_below = (below_threshold / total_entries) * 100

# Display the percentage information on the graph
ax.text(18, ax.get_ylim()[1] * 0.8,  # Set position
        f'{below_threshold} listings ({percentage_below:.1f}%) below 30 nights',
        fontsize=12, color='black', ha='center', bbox=dict(facecolor='white', alpha=0.6))

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Distribution of Minimum Nights', fontsize=15)
ax.set_xlabel('Minimum Nights')
ax.set_ylabel('Count')
ax.legend()

# Set x-axis ticks and labels
x_ticks = list(range(1, 8)) + list(range(10, 36, 5))  # Show daily ticks for the first 7 days, and every 5 days from 10 to 35
x_labels = [str(i) for i in x_ticks[:-1]] + ['35+']  # Define tick labels
ax.set_xticks(x_ticks)
ax.set_xticklabels(x_labels)

# Display the plot
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

```{python}
#| output: false

#Percentage of listings for which minimum nights are less than 7.
gdf[gdf['minimum_nights']<=7].shape[0] / total_entries # 0.9232768749285172
```

Based on the dataset, 93550 listings have a minimum night stay of less than the STR threshold (30 days), making up 97.3% of the total. Additionally, listings with a minimum stay of less than 7 days account for 92.3% of the total. 
**The London rental market on airbnb is dominated by short-term rentals.**

Chaudhary had illustrated some drawbacks of short term renting [@chaudhary2021effects].

1. **Reduced long-term housing supply**: Due to higher profits from short-term rentals (e.g., Airbnb), many landlords prioritize short-term leases over long-term rentals, exacerbating London's housing crisis and driving up rents, especially for low- and middle-income residents.
2. **Community impacts**: A high volume of short-term rentals can disrupt neighborhoods, increasing noise and tourist traffic, making communities less appealing for long-term residents and undermining stability and safety.


## 7. Drawing on your previous answers, and supporting your response with evidence (*e.g.* figures, maps, EDA/ESDA, and simple statistical analysis/models drawing on experience from, e.g., CASA0007), how *could* the InsideAirbnb data set be used to inform the regulation of Short-Term Lets (STL) in London?

## 构建多元线性回归模型来研究关系
```

In order to more intuitively prove the impact of Airbnb on the local community and explore the extent of the impact, we used the method of constructing a multiple linear regression model, where we calculated the housing price, population density, and median number of annual house sales of each ward, and took them as the dependent variables. We calculated the median number of Airbnb listings in each ward, monthly number of reviews, annual availablity, review rating, and number as independent variables.

```

Population density as the dependent variable:
By calculating the VIF value, we removed the variables with multicollinearity, and the R-square Score of the improved model is 0.42, which indicates that the related indicators of Airbnb will affect the local population density to an extent of 42%, which is a good result.

Prices and number of homes sold:
In the same multi-collinearity processing, we found through model analysis that factors such as price, quantity, monthly number of reviews and review scores on Airbnb would affect the house price of ward in the UK to a degree of 63%, but for the annual house sales, there was little influence, and only 1.8% of the change was related to Airbnb.
